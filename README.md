## Hi there!

I'm a full stack web developer.

Current side-projects:
- [grouchess - a lichess clone](https://github.com/nathanchica/grouchess)
  - [https://grouchess.vercel.app/](https://grouchess.vercel.app/) (Note: the backend service takes a full minute to wake back up)
  - a chess game in vite react + tailwindcss + typescript + express + socketio
  - just for fun and learning purposes
    - drag-and-drop, complex state management, websockets, monotonic clocks, [vitest browser mode](https://vitest.dev/guide/browser/why.html), etc.
    - minimal dependencies
- [live dashboard of berkeley bus 51b](https://github.com/nathanchica/where-is-51b)

  - learning Render for deploying the backend websocket service

## Hi there!

I'm a full stack web developer.  
React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Node.js, Python

Current side-projects:
- [a basic websocket chat application](https://github.com/nathanchica/chicachica)
  - [https://chicachica.vercel.app/](https://chicachica.vercel.app/)
  - learning websockets (socketio) and building a basic chat application
  - didn't implement proper user account management and authentication so you can just log in as any user. the project was just for fun and focused on learning websockets
  - vite react + express + socketio + neon serverless postgresDB
  - also learning Render for deploying the backend service instead of Vercel. the free tier instance goes to sleep after inactivity so first requests may time out
- [a website for my cats](https://github.com/nathanchica/grouchi)
  - [https://grouchi.vercel.app](https://grouchi.vercel.app)
  - learning HTMX and TailwindCSS

- [life event logger](https://github.com/nathanchica/life_event_logger_monorepo)
  - [https://nchica-event-logger.vercel.app](https://nchica-event-logger.vercel.app/)
  - learning to use Apollo Cache as data store and implement optimistic UI
  - learning Vite and Vitest (Migrated from CRA and Jest)
  - learning Vercel for deployments and Github Actions for CI/CD
  - learning Vercel Cron Jobs and Discord webhooks for notifications
  - I use this app to keep track of my cat chores
